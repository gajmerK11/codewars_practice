"""
Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.

Example 2:
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice."""
